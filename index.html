                <h4><kbd>The Arizona Cathedral Hike</kbd></h4>

                <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize ">I have visited this place in June/27/2021</h5>

                <p class="text-left text-muted">Cathedral Rock in Sedona is a short hike that offers great views of the naturally occurring rock formations in the heart of red rock country. Due to its incredible scenery and short distance, this is an extremely popular option for hikers of all ages. Be sure to put this one on your list if you ever find yourself hiking in Sedona!
                    The Cathedral Rock Trailhead can be accessed off of Back'O'Beyond Road. There are two parking lots. However, the trail can also be accessed from the Baldwin and Templeton trails.

                    The trip to the top of Cathedral Rock is an amazing hike in the southern part of Sedona. It's just under 1.5 miles round trip but the 740+ ft elevation gain make this a moderately difficult hike with portions where near vertical climbing is required. While you scramble your way up the rocky trail, be sure to follow the basket cairns to stay on track.

                    From the trailhead the hike can be half hour to an hour each way. The views at the top of the hike are more than worth it, especially during sunset. Be sure to wear proper closed toed hiking shoes with good grip for an easier climb up and down.

                    Dogs are allowed in this area, but it is not advisable to bring them on this trail. The route requires a lot of scrambling, which would be difficult for most dogs.</p>

                <h4><kbd>The Thirupati Tirumala Temple</kbd></h4>

                <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize ">I have visited this place in June/31/2018</h5>

                <p class="text-left text-muted">Venkateswara Temple is a Hindu temple situated in the hill town of Tirumala at Tirupati in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, India. The temple is dedicated to Venkateswara, a form of Vishnu, who is believed to have appeared here to save mankind from trials and troubles of Kali Yuga. Hence the place has also got the name Kaliyuga Vaikuntha and the Lord here is referred to as Kaliyuga Prathyaksha Daivam. The temple is also known by other names including Tirumala Temple, Tirupati Temple, Tirupati Balaji Temple. Venkateswara is known by many other names: Balaji, Govinda, and Srinivasa. The temple is run by the body Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) which is under direct control of the Andhra Pradesh Government, which also appoints the head of TTD and uses the revenue from the shrine.

                    Tirumala Hills are part of the Seshachalam Hills range. The hills are 853 metres (2,799 ft) above sea level. The Hills comprise seven peaks, representing the seven heads of Adisesha. The temple lies on the seventh peak, Venkatadri, on the southern banks of Sri Swami Pushkarini, a holy water tank. Hence the temple is also referred to as the "Temple of Seven Hills". Tirumala town covers about 10.33 sq mi (26.75 km2) in area.[citation needed]


                    It is the richest temple in the world in terms of donations received and wealth. The temple is visited by about 50,000 to 100,000 pilgrims daily (30 to 40 million people annually on average), while on special occasions and festivals, like the annual Brahmotsavam, the number of pilgrims shoots up to 500,000, making it the most-visited holy place in the world. In 2016, it was reported that 27.3 million pilgrims visited the temple.

                <p>As I am a great fan of marvel
                    Avengers: Endgame', which marks the end of the Infinity Saga, is spellbinding and surely an enthralling experience. The last film of the 'Avengers' franchise is remarkable and doesn't disappoint. Watching all our favorite superheroes in one film is just surpassing. Marvel has been working on this grand culmination ever since they released 'Iron Man'. I'm damn sure that all of their hard work and ambition have paid off. The directors, Anthony and Joe Russo have made sure that it delivers an unforgettable experience. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have come up with a screenplay full of epic and unpredictable moments. The film has a great balance of humor, emotions, and action. The biggest strength of the film is the emotions. This is the most emotional superhero film I have ever seen. It's just perfect. The action sequences were jaw-dropping. The climactic battle left me amazed. It's just filled with memorable moments and cannot be described with words. The visuals are gorgeous and have a great impact on the film. The humor doesn't look exaggerated and manages to entertain throughout the film. The plot twists were very impressive and suspenseful. The film features many cameos of characters from the previous MCU films, which just gives a double dose of excitement. The background score gives me goosebumps, though I've listened to it several times. It was really clever to make changes to the characterization of the Hulk. I enjoyed that a lot. But the show-stealer is Robert Downey Jr, who plays the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man. The man who started it all proves yet again that there's no one else who can perfect his role. Do not miss his powerful moments in the final battle.</p>

                <p>HAKUNA MATATA.... I really loved this song...
                    I haven’t had the fortune of watching the 1994 original The Lion King or the 2012 3D re-release in theaters, but I still remember watching the it on Television after it was digitally re-mastered. From then on, it has been on my top favourite list. I have watched the movie again and again and still cherish the experience.

                    Jon Favreau’s The Jungle Book (2016) was an absolute treat! And the moment I came to know about him taking on The Lion King, I was super excited. Jon Favreau’s vision regarding this film has been very clear from the beginning. He wanted to take his Photo-realistic CGI technology he used in The Jungle Book to the next level making his film look almost as real as a BBC/Discovery Nature Documentary, and he has made it happen. Visually, The Lion King is a majestic and breathtaking experience. If a person isn’t aware of the technology used in the film, s/he will completely be convinced of the film being live action and the characters and scenarios being real. The hard-work of Favreau and the Visual effects team has paid off well. They deserve a standing ovation for this.

                    Does the realism of the characters feel as a compromise on the facial expressions and stunts like we had in the animated one? Well, it does. In the traditionally animated movie, animals could be made to give human like profound expressions and perform actions and stunts which isn’t seen in real life. And this film has focused on realism as the defining factor. Thus, making animals show those facial expressions, dance around and perform stunts like they did in animated classic isn’t possible.

                    Coming to the story, it has been more or less the same. Some liberation have been taken, there are some scenes removed and some new scenes added. Even a few characters have been modified. While some changes are welcomed, there are a few aspects that I wish were kept same like original.

                    The background score and music by Hans Zimmer is an upgrade on the original which stays grounded to the soul of the original and further builds upon it. Certain renditions felt even more intense and impactful. Songs composed by Tim Rice and Elton John are more or less the same like the original and Beyonce has done a great job, her rendition of new song Spirit is a soulful piece. Be prepared has been cut short and re-written, but feels adequate according to the film’s situation and script changes.
                    Overall ,it is a fun and entertaining movie which should definitely be experienced at theaters</p>

                <p>Spoilers ahead - I don't know why people don't like this one. It's BRILLIANT! Cap on a motorcycle, the chemistry between Hulk and Black Widow, Wanda coming on board, Hawkeye's wife telling him he has more to lose than the rest of his friends. The birth of Vision, and his refusal to become one of Stark's mindless bots. And Ultron really knows how to throw both punches, and punchlines! Even Warmachine's desire to impress Tony and the gang at that party. I felt a lot of emotion and heart in the characters, which is uncommon in Superhero movies. Even Hulk showed regret, after collaterally killing innocent people in South Africa.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Foldable phones are still somewhat of a niche, but Samsung is looking to change that. The company just took the wraps off of the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 — two promising folding smartphones that look to improve on their predecessors with more durable designs, cool new features (like pen support) and prices that are slightly less eye-watering than before. These phones will still run you a premium at $999 for the Z Flip 3 and $1,799 for the Z Fold 3, but they’re some of Samsung’s most attainable foldables yet.

                    Samsung also revealed plenty of other cool new gadgets at its Galaxy Unpacked event that won’t run you a few thousand dollars. The $149 Galaxy Buds 2 feature a gorgeous and lightweight design, as well as a number of promising features for their relatively low price (including active noise cancellation). And for the wearable fans out there, the new Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic are poised to be a serious Apple Watch rival, thanks to their all-new user interface and wide range of wellness-minded features.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> We posed this question on August 3, with over 2,200 votes counted in this poll. The single most popular price window people were willing to pay is $900 to $999, representing 26.1% of the vote. This was closely followed by the $800 to $899 price bracket at 24.7%. In third place was the $699 to $799 segment, with 23.1% of respondents said they’d buy the Pixel 6 Pro if it were in this price range.

                    Just over 19% of voters said they’d pay between $1,000 and $1,199 for the Pixel 6 Pro. The least popular option was the $1,200+ bracket though, as only 6.2% of polled readers say they’d spend that much on Google’s Pro device.

                    Over half of all respondents are willing to spend $900+ on the phone when we combine the $900 to $999, $1,000 to $1,199, and $1,200+ segments. Meanwhile, just under 48% of respondents are willing to spend $899 or less when we combine the $800 to $899 and $699 to $799 segments.

                    Either way, it’s worth noting that phones with high-end chipsets, water resistance, wireless charging, and periscope cameras don’t tend to be affordable flagships. The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra, for example, comes in at €1,200 (~$1,408) in Europe and Rs 70,000 (~$941) in India. Meanwhile, the S21 Ultra retails for $1,199.</p>
